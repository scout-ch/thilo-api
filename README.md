# Thilo API - Backend of Thilo
Schweizer PfadibÃ¼chlein Thilo, das Original.

The Thilo contains a lot of interesting and useful information about the Scouts and belongs on every Scout's bedside table and in his or her bag. Contents: The scout movement, the world we live in, scout techniques, first aid, nature and the environment, camp life, etc.

An headless CSM implemented using [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) serves as backend for the thilo project. Strapi provides an intuitive interface to manage the multi medial content and provides well defined REST endpoints to consume the data.
